I love the challenge we face as engineers of being pragmatic and finding the simplest possible solution, but at the same time using beautiful technology such as functional programming where it's appropriate. I have extensive experience with TypeScript, React, RxJS, and have taken on such tasks as delegation of processing to a web worker, building an infinitely scrollable list, building a rich text editor editor, and creating a developer-friendly API for reporting all user interactions to analytics platforms. Feel free to reach out: Twitter DMs are open, and my email is on my GitHub profile.","author":"@ivan7237d","github":"https://github.com/ivan7237d","linkedin":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/ivan-novikov-1881981b3/"}},"allMarkdownRemark":{"edges":[]}},"pageContext":{}},"staticQueryHashes":["63159454"]}
